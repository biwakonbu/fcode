# Requirements Document

## Introduction

品質ゲート統合機能は、fcodeのAIチーム協働開発環境において、QualityGateManagerの判定結果をリアルタイムでUI表示し、POが品質状況を即座に把握できるようにする機能です。この機能により、18分スプリント中の品質チェックプロセスが可視化され、POは技術的詳細を理解することなく品質判断を行えるようになります。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Product Owner, I want to see real-time quality gate results in the dashboard, so that I can make informed decisions about release readiness without understanding technical details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN QualityGateManager performs a quality check THEN the dashboard SHALL display the overall quality status within 2 seconds
2. WHEN a quality gate passes THEN the system SHALL show a green indicator with completion percentage
3. WHEN a quality gate fails THEN the system SHALL show a red indicator with specific failure reasons in user-friendly language
4. WHEN quality checks are in progress THEN the system SHALL show a yellow indicator with progress information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Product Owner, I want to see detailed quality metrics in an easy-to-understand format, so that I can assess the overall health of the development work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing quality gate results THEN the system SHALL display test coverage percentage with visual indicators
2. WHEN viewing quality gate results THEN the system SHALL display code quality score (A-F grade) with explanation
3. WHEN viewing quality gate results THEN the system SHALL display performance metrics (response time, memory usage) in business terms
4. WHEN quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide recommended actions in plain language

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Product Owner, I want to receive notifications when quality gates require my attention, so that I can intervene when necessary without constantly monitoring the dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a critical quality gate fails THEN the system SHALL display a prominent notification requiring PO acknowledgment
2. WHEN quality gates are blocked waiting for external dependencies THEN the system SHALL notify the PO with context and options
3. WHEN quality trends show degradation over multiple sprints THEN the system SHALL alert the PO with trend analysis
4. IF quality gate notifications are dismissed THEN the system SHALL track dismissal reasons for future analysis

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Product Owner, I want to see quality gate history and trends, so that I can understand the team's quality improvement over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing quality dashboard THEN the system SHALL display quality trends over the last 4 sprints
2. WHEN viewing quality history THEN the system SHALL show improvement or degradation patterns with visual charts
3. WHEN quality metrics change significantly THEN the system SHALL highlight the changes and provide context
4. WHEN comparing sprint quality THEN the system SHALL show velocity vs quality correlation analysis

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Product Owner, I want to configure quality gate thresholds, so that I can set appropriate quality standards for my product.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing quality settings THEN the system SHALL allow PO to set minimum test coverage thresholds (default 80%)
2. WHEN accessing quality settings THEN the system SHALL allow PO to set acceptable performance thresholds (response time, memory)
3. WHEN quality thresholds are changed THEN the system SHALL apply new thresholds to current and future quality checks
4. IF quality thresholds are set too low or high THEN the system SHALL provide warnings with industry standard recommendations
